# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

As the baby boomers are slowly retiring, many companies are looking to forecast how much of an output deficit they'll be in over the next few years Bobby's manager tasked him to find out how many employees will be retiring by each department. Bobby's manager also wants to focus on the next generation of senior employees who will have to pick up the brunt of the work once the "silver tsunami" hits so he wants Bobby to see how many were born in 1965 by department. They will hopefully be able to mentor the next crop of workers at the company.

## Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
### Deliverable 1
* Pewlett Hackard will need to invest in a recruting effort for both Staff and Engineers
* There will also be a large shortage in Senior members of the to onboard these new Staff members and Engineers so they should start with those before recruting the lower levels

### Deliverable 2
* There are 1,549 employees eligible to be mentors
* This far less than the number potentially retiring so Pewlett-Hackard could be setting themselves up for quite the deficit
* They should be focusing on the Staff and Engineer roles 

## Summary

### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

There will be around 90K jobs opening up as those born from 1952-1955 and within the retirement period start to leave. The biggest gaps will be in Engineering and Staff. 


### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

There are 1549 Eligible Mentors across various branches. Depending on the ratio of mentees to mentors this might not be enough. Pewlett Hackard should consider a large recruting push for senior engineers and staff not only to increase mentors but also to fill the gaps of the retirees. In additon, they should consider expanding the criteria for the mentors.
